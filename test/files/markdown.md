# REST API Design Guidelines

## Introduction
What you will find in this repository is a list of guidelines we follow at [Inaka](http://inaka.net) when designing our REST APIs.
These guidelines are not taxative, some exceptions can be found here or there, but we do base our tools (like [Jayme](http://github.com/inaka/Jayme), [Dayron](http://github.com/inaka/Dayron) and [SumoREST](http://github.com/inaka/sumo_rest)) on them. That's why, if you're going to use one of those tools, it would be much simpler to have a server that complies to the following guides.

## Conventions & Rules

#### Maintain existing style

> When editing a system written by someone else, stick to the style in which it was designed. If a project has an overall style, stick to that when adding, removing or updating API endpoints as well.
